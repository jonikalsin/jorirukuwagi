Sirianni is a native of Jamestown, New York. He hails from a football–oriented family which includes his dad, a former high school football coach named Fran. There are also his brothers, Jay and Mike, who have both coached high school and college football respectively. The name of Nick Sirianni’s mother is Amy.</p><p>Sirianni played college football at a lowly Ohio college named Mount Union. He was not drafted into the NFL and spent one season playing in the alternative American Indoor Football League. He later started his coaching career in 2004/2005. Nick Sirianni initially served as a defensive backs coach at his alma mater, Mount Union. He then joined IUP as their wide receivers coach from 2006 to 2008.</p><p>In 2009, Nick Sirianni landed his first gig with the NFL, specifically the Kansas City Chiefs.

She lived by herself in an apartment complex and one of her<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> neighbors</a> happened to be Nick Sirianni. Sirianni was then working as a lowly position coach at the Kansas City Chiefs and he found her quite attractive. He asked her out but she turned him down. He did not give up though and she later decided to give him a chance. They started dating afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Brett-Ashley-Cantwell-1.jpg><h2><strong>She Became Nick Sirianni’s Wife in 2013 and They Now Have Three Children Together</strong></h2><p>The romance between Brett Ashley Cantwell and Nick Sirianni blossomed for about 24 months before they got engaged. They later tied the knot in 2013. The couple remains together to date and has welcomed <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">three</a> kids together.

Brett Ashley Cantwell has been a pillar of support for her husband.</p><p>She gladly relocated with him to the various cities that work demanded of him namely San Diego and Indianapolis. She also encouraged him through the highs and lows of victory and losses. Brett Ashley Cantwell has also dedicated herself to running the home front and this has given her husband the impetus to go for the stars.</p><p>Thankfully, their efforts have not been in vain as he was appointed the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in 2021. He achieved that feat at the age of 40 making him one of the youngest to record such.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Brett-Ashley-Cantwell-2.jpg><h3><strong>Nick Sirianni’s Wife Prefers Staying Out of the Spotlight</strong></h3><p>Being the wife of an NFL head coach has automatically conferred celebrity status on Brett Ashley Cantwell but she doesn’t seem to be so enthusiastic about exploring that status. While most people in her shoes will showcase their lives on social media or appear on reality TV series, Cantwell does not seem to want such.</p><p>She does not have Instagram or Twitter accounts while her Facebook account rarely sees any activity. She also limits her red carpet outings with her husband. The lady cherishes living a private life and this is not a bad idea at all. She is able to provide as normal a life as possible for her kids. It also means that she and her husband do not have to deal with any unsavory rumors that will pile pressure on their union or even split them apart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdl7%2BmwNNmmKygnJrGbq%2FAp6uwnZyheqbCxKuwraCZo7RurcGorK1lnp6wrHnSoqmimZ6jtrR51qKdnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html&text=Who%20is%20Brett%20Ashley%20Cantwell%3f%20Everything%20About%20Nick%20Sirianni%27s%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Brett%20Ashley%20Cantwell%3f%20Everything%20About%20Nick%20Sirianni%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Brett%20Ashley%20Cantwell%3f%20Everything%20About%20Nick%20Sirianni%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Brett%20Ashley%20Cantwell%3f%20Everything%20About%20Nick%20Sirianni%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-brett-ashley-cantwell-everything-about-nick-siriannis-wife.html&description=Who%20is%20Brett%20Ashley%20Cantwell%3f%20Everything%20About%20Nick%20Sirianni%27s%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./age-height-girlfriend-net-worth-career-of-dante-martin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career Of Dante Martin">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mia-khalifa-4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mia Khalifa Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family and Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

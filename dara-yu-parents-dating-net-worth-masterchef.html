So, Dara Yu, a contestant on Season 1 of MasterChef Junior ranked as the Runner Up at the time, took down the two adult men for the win. After weeks of intensive cooking competitions, Dara became the official winner of the&nbsp;MasterChef&nbsp;trophy at only 20.</p><p style=text-align:left>Now let’s look at her Masterchef journey, stories about her parents, dating life, and net worth in the rest of the writing.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Dara Yu Masterchef 12 Winner</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Winning Masterchef 12 was a surreal experience for Dara Yu. She said she had gone back into the MasterChef kitchen for this season just like. “Let’s just have fun and see what happens”, she had thought.</p><p style=text-align:left>As for her young age, Dara told Parade.com that she never saw it as a disadvantage. Also, she pointed out that since several of this season’s contestants were from seasons that aired after her season of MasterChef Junior, they only had maybe five years of professional experience compared to her eight (even if they were older than her).</p><p style=text-align:left>She is also used to being the youngest in the kitchen because she has been working in the industry since she was 12.</p><p style=text-align:left>Dara’s winning menu was based on the assortment of some childhood favorites plus the French techniques she learned at culinary school.</p><p style=text-align:left>Since the win, Dara also has talked about her strategy going into the final cook, where she gets her ideas for what to make for each challenge, how much luck plays a part, and more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Much Is Dara Yu’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Dara Yu’s net worth was reported to be standing above $200 thousand as of 2022.

Also, she thought she may be will be investing a good amount of her prize money. Maybe in some passion projects and possible future food businesses she shared. And then, she would maybe spend some of it on traveling.</p><p style=text-align:left>In the future, Dara would like to pursue teaching/educating, sharing her knowledge with other young, upcoming cooks, and, she said, for that may be she will turn to the TV or the internet.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Dara Yu’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>George Yu and Carole Yu are Dara Yu’s parents.</p><p style=text-align:left>Dara Yu’s dad, George Yu is no more. He passed away at the age of 43 on 7 July 2007 in Los Angeles, California, after a long and painful battle with a rare type of lung cancer that afflicts nonsmokers.</p><p style=text-align:left>He was a pioneer in digital architecture.

Dara was 10 at the time Carole got married to Scott Stewart. Scott, like Carole, was Los Angeles based as of 2022 and he loved telling his story on YouTube. Carole too seemed to be successfully running the “This Is Yu” podcast and a YouTube channel called ‘Yu Can Cook’.</p><p style=text-align:left>Back in 2018, entrepreneur and independent business owner, Carole talked about coping with her husband’s death while raising two young daughters, in a podcast.

He has been in the music industry for nearly four decades, and has also pursued a solo career and a new group called Heads of State. But how much is Ralph Tresvant’s net worth, and how did he earn it? Let’s find out.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and New Edition</strong></h3><p>Ralph Tresvant was born on May 16, 1968, in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to Patricia and Ralph Hall. He has an older sister named LaTonya and a younger brother named Andre. He grew up enjoying music with his siblings and friends, and formed a group called New Edition with Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell, and Michael Bivins when he was in junior high school. They were discovered by a local producer named Brooke Payne, who gave them the name New Edition to signify they were a new edition of the Jackson 5. They were signed by Maurice Starr to his independent label Streetwise Records in 1983.</p><p>Their debut album, Candy Girl, was a success, spawning hits like “Popcorn Love”, “Is This the End”, and the title track. They soon left Starr’s label and signed with MCA Records, where they released their self-titled second album in 1984. This album featured more hits like “Cool It Now”, “Mr. Telephone Man”, and “Lost in Love”. Tresvant’s smooth and approachable vocal style became a signature for the group, and he was often the lead singer on most of their songs.</p><p>In 1985, they released their third album, All for Love, which had songs like “Count Me Out” and “A Little Bit of Love (Is All It Takes)”. However, tensions arose within the group, and Bobby Brown left to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Johnny Gill, who gave the group a more mature and adult contemporary sound. Their fourth album, Heart Break, was released in 1988, and was a huge success. It had songs like “If It Isn’t Love”, “Can You Stand the Rain”, and “N.E. Heartbreak”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Solo Career and Other Projects</strong></h3><p>After the success of Heart Break, the members of New Edition decided to pursue solo projects or form new groups. Tresvant was initially reluctant to go solo, but he eventually agreed after seeing the success of his former bandmates. He released his self-titled debut solo album in 1990, which went double platinum and had hits like “Sensitivity”, “Do What I Gotta Do”, and “Stone Cold Gentleman”. He also appeared in the movie House Party 2, where he performed the song “Yo Baby Yo”.</p><p>In 1992, he recorded a song for the Mo’ Money soundtrack called “Money Can’t Buy You Love”, which reached the top three on the R&B chart. He also collaborated with Whitney Houston on the song “Somebody Bigger Than You and I” for The Preacher’s Wife soundtrack in 1996. He released his second solo album, It’s Goin’ Down, in 1993, but it did not do as well as his first one.</p><p>In 1996, he reunited with all six members of New Edition – Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Johnny Gill, and himself – to release their sixth album, Home Again. The album was a success, and had songs like “Hit Me Off” and “I’m Still in Love with You”. They also went on a reunion tour that lasted until 1997. However, Brown left the group again after some conflicts with the other members.</p><p>Tresvant continued to work on his solo career, and released his third album, Rizz-Wa-Faire, in 2006. The album had songs like “My Homegirl” and “Something to Give You”. He also formed a new group with Brown and Gill called Heads of State in 2008. They toured together and performed songs from their respective careers.</p><p>In 2017, he starred as himself in the biographical miniseries The New Edition Story, which chronicled the rise and fall of the group. He also released a single called “All Mine” with Johnny Gill in 2020.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ralph Tresvant Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to various sources, Ralph Tresvant’s net worth is estimated to be around $8 million as of 2021. He has earned most of his wealth through his successful music career as a member of New Edition and as a solo artist. He has also made money from his acting roles and his appearances on various soundtracks.</p><p>Tresvant has been married twice in his life. He married his childhood sweetheart Shelly in 1993, and they had two daughters, Na’Quelle and Mariah. They divorced in 1996. He then married Amber Serrano in 2004, and they have a son, Dakari. He lives in Acworth, Georgia, with his family.</p><p>Ralph Tresvant is one of the most influential and talented singers in the R&B genre. He has been a part of the music industry for almost 40 years, and has given us many memorable songs and performances. He is a legend in his own right, and his net worth reflects his achievements and contributions to the music world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfp66tvMdmq6udo6uur8CMp5ytZaekv7W0jKGmsGWdqrCpecisZK2glWK7psOMnpuirJmku26%2FyKeenqpdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html&text=Ralph%20Tresvant%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20is%20the%20New%20Edition%20Singer%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html&title=Ralph%20Tresvant%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20is%20the%20New%20Edition%20Singer%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html&title=Ralph%20Tresvant%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20is%20the%20New%20Edition%20Singer%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html&title=Ralph%20Tresvant%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20is%20the%20New%20Edition%20Singer%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fralph-tresvant-net-worth-how-much-is-the-new-edition-singer-worth.html&description=Ralph%20Tresvant%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20is%20the%20New%20Edition%20Singer%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./s-leyman-felek.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sleyman Felek">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./oc-parks-free-sunset-cinema-announces-summer-film-series-lineup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="OC Parks free Sunset Cinema announces summer film series lineup">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

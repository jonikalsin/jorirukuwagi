Is he married? Who are his parents? What job does he have?</p><p>Read all about him in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Brad Fiorenza On The Challenge Season 39</strong></h3><p>The Challenge has returned for season 39 and Brad Fiorenza is one of the 24 contenders this season.</p><p>He is the Cutthroat champion and has appeared on The Duel, The Gauntlet III, The Duel II, and All Stars 3. He also appeared in Battle of the Sexes 2, The Inferno II, The Gauntlet 2, The Ruins, Vendettas, Final Reckoning, and All Stars 2 as a competitor.</p><p>In total, he has won $75,000.</p><h3><strong>Is Brad Fiorenza Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Brad Fiorenza is a single dad now. But, he was previously married to his ex-wife Tori Hall. Although they found love in The Challenge, it couldn’t last forever.</p><p>Tori and Brad, who married in 2010 two years after meeting on MTV’s The Gauntlet III, separated in 2015 and divorced in December 2016. In an exclusive reply to Us Weekly, the former Miss Teen USA, who has not been on reality television since 2010, responded to her ex’s charges.</p><p>Their relationship drama went public when Brad accused his ex-wife Tori of turning their sons against him. “Kids are not possessions, they are people. If you teach your kids to dislike one parent, even if you were raised that way, it’s like telling them they are half bad. In my opinion that is child abuse & not negotiable,” he tweeted on Wednesday, April 17, 2019.</p><p>Brad sent many further texts between then and Friday, April 19, but never mentioned Tori by name. When one of his fans informed him that he has rights as a father, “It costs a lot of money to keep enforcing them. I wouldn’t wish this on anybody. I still count my blessings every day but talk about pain.”</p><p>Brad also claimed that he tried to discuss the situation with Tori privately but “it only got my kids moved out of state,” adding, “I sat on a pile of receipts from another man’s wife for 2 years.”</p><p>“When I hear of Brad saying something or tweeting irrational, I try to go to the mindset that he is hurting, and hurt people hurt people,” Tori shared. “I will always encourage the boys to have a relationship with their dad. Always. To say otherwise is simply untrue. I’m not operating in a place of hurt or anger, so my stance on this isn’t as emotionally driven as others. I took time to heal and deal with the divorce, and it’s made all the difference. Three years ago my response to this would have been very different.”</p><p>Tori also denied any claims of cheating. “As far as me having an affair or breaking up another family, there is no truth to that. None,” the Road Rules&nbsp;vet told&nbsp;Us. “I know people would love for this to be the case so that they could pinpoint the reasoning/fault of our divorce, but it’s just not true.”</p><p>His son Brady turned 12 years old in August 2023. Back in 2017, Brad wished his son, “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! to the cutest 6-year-old, I know!! This boy changed my life forever 6 years ago today. I enjoy every second I get of watching Brady grow!!&nbsp; <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#HappyBirthday</a> 💪❤️☝️.”</p><p>His younger boy Chase celebrated his 8th birthday in January 2023. Brad wished his younger son, “Happy 3rd Birthday to the sweetest & cutest 3-year-old I know!! Being your dad is the biggest blessing ever! I LOVE you to the moon and back Chase!! <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#HappyBirthday</a>.”</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Brad back in 2003 was in relationship with <span class=xt0psk2>Southern Illinois University Carbondale</span> (SIUC) alumni and former homecoming queen Andrea Gilio.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Brad Fiorenza?</strong></h3><p>Brad Fiorenza’s date of birth is 11 November 1980.

When MTV called to inquire about Fiorenza’s missing tape, he felt compelled to submit one.</p><p>Brad soon flew to Los Angeles for the competition’s second phase.</p><p>“He was excited. He really wanted to do it at that point,” his mom Sherry said. “Summer was on hold for us; it was pretty tense.”</p><p>Brad did not pursue other job interviews because he was waiting to discover what would happen with the “Real World.”</p><p>Sherry Fiorenza was conflicted about the situation. Though she was pleased for her kid, she was disappointed by the missed opportunity to seek other opportunities.</p><p>Brad is a graduate of Carl Sandburg High School. He graduated in 1998.

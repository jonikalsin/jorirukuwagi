And while the analogy may not reflect the way Probst’s fans were done in by the host, it does reveal his love for secrecy. As it turned out, Probst had secretly tied the knot to Lisa Ann Rusell in 2011. But instead of revealing his marriage to his fans, Probst tweeted out that he had an important personal event to get to. As it turned out, the important personal event was his marriage to Lisa Ann Rusell. And given Probst’s secrecy in revealing his marriage, it is safe to say that Rusell shares the same views. So for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Lisa Ann Rusell.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and career:</h2><p>Lisa Ann Russell was born on the 21st of March 1972, in Sterling, Illinois, United States. Born and raised in Sterling, Rusell fell in love with acting at a very young age. Following her graduation from high school, Rusell moved to California and enrolled at a University. While still at university, Rusell landed a gig as a model and started working with Revlon. While Rusell worked as a model for most of her early years, she developed an acute interest in movies late in her career. She made her debut in 1993, with the TV series, Saved by the Bell: The College Years. Her big-screen appearance came a year later as Russell was cast as Natasha Sinclair in the movie A.P.E.X. In 1995, Rusell had the briefest of appearances in Twisted Love. She landed the role of Princess Salazar in the 1998 version of Sinbad: The Battle of the Dark Knights. She also made the briefest of appearances on The Jeff Probst Show in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Ann-Russell-Jeff-Probsts-wife.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life:</h2><p>Lisa Ann Rusell is happily married to Jeff Probst. While she has been with Probst for over a decade, she was previously married to Mark-Paul Gosselaar. The pair first met on set and tied the knot on the 26th of August 1996. In their years as a couple, Rusell and Gosselaar had two lovely children, Michael Charles Gosselaar who was born on the 31st of January 2004, and Ava Lorenn Gosselaar who was born on the 7th of May 2006. The pair called things off on the 27th of May 2011, but not much is known about the reasons for their divorce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life with Probst:</h2><p>Like Russell, Probst has a divorce in common but has no children from his ex-wife <a href=#>Shelly Wright</a>. After the divorce in 2001, Probst remained unmarried for years and things changed for him after meeting Rusell. The pair met around 2010 and tied the knot on December 5, 2011. However, for the time being, the pair kept the details of their wedding a secret only to reveal it later in 2012.</p><p>In over a decade of marriage, the pair has not given birth to any children while Probst is stepfather to two of Rusell’s children from her previous relationship. Talking about his relationship with kids Probst is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>told</a>:</p><p>“We’re a blended family, so they are technically—not technically, they are my stepkids—I think of them as mine, which is crazy, but then they have this other family…but I always have to remember they have a dad.”</p><p>Despite having little to no hiccups in their marriage, things took an awkward turn in 2017 when Rusell wanted Probst to quit the survivor series. It was later revealed that Rusell wanted more help with the kids and while Probst never left the show it is safe to say that the duo reached an amicable solution.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Jeff Probst:</h2><p>Jeff Probst is an American game show host and executive producer. He is best known for hosting the popular reality television show “Survivor,” which has been on the air since 2000.</p><p>Probst was born on November 4, 1961, in Wichita, Kansas, and grew up in Bellevue, Washington. He attended Seattle Pacific University, where he earned a degree in religious studies. After graduation, Probst worked as a host and producer for various TV shows, including “Rock & Roll Jeopardy!.”</p><p>In 2000, Probst was chosen to host “Survivor,” a reality TV show in which contestants are stranded on a deserted island and compete in challenges to win money and immunity from elimination. The show became an instant hit and has since aired more than 42 seasons. Probst’s engaging personality and ability to bring out the drama and emotions of the contestants have made him a beloved figure to millions of fans.</p><p>In addition to his work on “Survivor,” Probst has also hosted various other reality TV shows, including “The Jeff Probst Show,” a daytime talk show that aired in 2012. He has won numerous awards for his hosting work, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Host.</p><p>Probst is also involved in various philanthropic endeavors, including the Jeff Probst Foundation, which he founded to support children in need.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth:</h2><p>Former American model and actress Lisa Ann Russes has kept the details of her riches mostly private while her husband Jeff Probst’s net worth stands at a whopping USD50 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=5><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Full Name:</th><td>Lisa Ann Russell</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Birth Date:</th><td>March 21, 1972</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Age:</strong></td><td>50 years old</td></tr><tr readability=4><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Birth Place:</th><td>Sterling, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Parents name:</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Zodiac:</strong></td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Sexuality:</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Marital Status:</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Husband:</strong></td><td>Mark-Paul Gosselaar&nbsp;(m. 1996–2011), &nbsp;Jeff Probst&nbsp;(m. 2011)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Children:</strong></td><td>Michael Charles Gosselaar,&nbsp;Ava Lorenn Gosselaar</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td>Former Model and Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Net Worth:</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th class=has-text-align-left data-align=left>Eye Color:</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-left data-align=left><strong>Social Media Handle:</strong></td><td>Private</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGijoquRYq6vuoyrrKydnKF8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html&text=Who%20is%20Lisa%20Ann%20Rusell%20%5bJeff%20Probst%20wife%5d%3f%20Wiki%2c%20bio%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20kids.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html&title=Who%20is%20Lisa%20Ann%20Rusell%20%5bJeff%20Probst%20wife%5d%3f%20Wiki%2c%20bio%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html&title=Who%20is%20Lisa%20Ann%20Rusell%20%5bJeff%20Probst%20wife%5d%3f%20Wiki%2c%20bio%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html&title=Who%20is%20Lisa%20Ann%20Rusell%20%5bJeff%20Probst%20wife%5d%3f%20Wiki%2c%20bio%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-ann-rusell.html&description=Who%20is%20Lisa%20Ann%20Rusell%20%5bJeff%20Probst%20wife%5d%3f%20Wiki%2c%20bio%2c%20net%20worth%2c%20kids." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./armani-watts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Armani Watts | Fan Arch">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanderpump-rules-raquel-leviss-reached-her-limit-with-fiance-james-kennedys-nasty-behavior-gave-back-100k-ring.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanderpump Rules Raquel Leviss reached her limit with fianc James Kennedys nasty behavior">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

She has also written two books directed at kids, which share personal stories as well as offer advice. Lizzie was born with an extremely rare congenital disease called Marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome that, among other symptoms, prevents her from accumulating body fat and adding weight.</strong><span id=more-84857></span></p><p>Lizzie’s conditions resulted in bullying during her childhood. In her teenage years, Lizzie faced cyberbullying, which ultimately inspired her to take up motivational speaking. Lizzie’s first work, co-authored with her mother, Rita, is a self-published autobiography published in 2010 in both English and Spanish. It is titled Lizzie Beautiful: The Lizzie Velásquez Story and includes letters her mother wrote to her as a child.</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Age</h2><p>Lizzie was born on <strong>March 13, 1989,</strong> in Austin, Texas, in the <a href=#><strong>United States</strong></a>. She is <strong>34 years old.</strong> Lizzie celebrates her birthday on March 13, every year.</p><h2>Lizzie Velásquez Height</h2><p>She is a woman of average stature. Lizzie stands at a height of <strong>5 ft 5 in</strong> (Approx 1.65 m).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/factsbuddy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lizzie-Velasquez-1.jpg><h2>Lizzie Velásquez Family</h2><p>She was born and brought up in Austin, Texas, by her parents. Lizzie is the eldest of three children named <strong>Marina and Chris</strong>. Lizzie is the daughter of <strong>Rita Borja Velásquez </strong>and <strong>Guadalupe Fonsi Velásquez.</strong> in addition, Lizzie was born four weeks prematurely and weighed less than 2 pounds 11 ounces (1,219 grams).</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Married</h2><p>Regarding her personal relationships, Lizzie was rumored to have been engaged to her fiance in 2015, however, Lizzie quickly clarified that she was not and was not looking for a husband either. Though, she did, however, date an ex-boyfriend, who she refers to as Blake, twice during her college years. Even so, Lizzie is single at the moment.</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Education</h2><p>She attended and studied at Texas State University until late 2012, majoring in communication studies.</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Syndrome</h2><p>Her condition is a very rare, previously undiagnosed, and non-terminal genetic disorder. Lizzie’s condition bears similarities to many other conditions, especially progeria. Medical researchers at the Campus of Texas Southwestern Medical Center initially speculated that it may be a form of neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS) (Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome), which does not affect her healthy bones, organs, and teeth.</p><p>Lizzie is medically unable to gain weight, which is a hallmark of her rare disorder. Lizzie has never weighed over 29 kg (64 lbs) and reportedly has almost 0% body fat. Additionally, Lizzie is required to eat many small meals and snacks throughout the day, averaging between 5,000 and 8,000 calories daily. Moreover, Lizzie is blind in her right eye, which started to cloud over when she was four, and she became vision-impaired in her left eye.</p><p>In 2015, it was disclosed that Lizzie and another woman named Abby Solomon, with the same but less severe variant of the condition, have mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes the proprotein of the novel hormone asprosin, and that this mutation results in asprosin deficiency and is responsible for their conditions. This condition is specifically named Marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome or simply Marfan lipodystrophy syndrome.</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Youtube</h2><p>Ever since Lizzie was dubbed the “World’s Ugliest Woman” in a video posted on YouTube in 2006, when she was at the age of 17, Lizzie has spoken out against bullying. In January 2014 Lizzie gave a TEDxAustinWomen Talk titled “How Do YOU Define Yourself” and her YouTube videos have received more than 54 million views. Lizzie is noted for her optimism. In 2015, during National Bullying Prevention Month, Lizzie hosted a social media challenge for Bystander Revolution’s Month of Action.</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Quotes</h2><p>– “Loving God and being open to him will change your life. Even the smallest step toward God will be rewarded by his grace.”<br>– “If you want to change the world, you start small, right at home.”<br>– “We don’t have to allow ourselves to be defined by the labels imposed on us. We get to define ourselves.”<br>– “The love that family members share is essential, and it’s so important to highlight it no matter what else might be happening.”<br>– “You are perfect just as you are, and so am I.”<br>– “Even if you look a little unusual, you’re a member of the human race.”<br>– “No one else has the same story as you, and that’s a good thing.”<br>– “The truth is that there’s something unique about each and every one of us. Everyone has a superpower of one kind or another.”</p><h2>Lizzie Velasquez Movie</h2><p>A documentary film named A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velásquez Story began at SXSW on March 14, 2015.

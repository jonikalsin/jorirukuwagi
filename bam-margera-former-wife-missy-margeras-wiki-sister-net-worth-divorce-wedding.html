However, the couple divorced in 2012 after being married for five years. Do you want to know more about Missy’s life, her marriage and divorce, and her career as well? If yes, then stay with us, we will break to you all there is to know about this successful model and actress.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2><p>Melissa was brought up by a single mother, Marian Rothstein; there is no information about her biological father and whether she has any siblings or not. She attended West Chester East High School, and after matriculating enrolled at Pennsylvania State University, from which she obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Communication.</p><h2><span id=Career_Start>Career Start</span></h2><p>From an early age Missy wanted to become a model, however, her career eventually took her onto the other side of the entertainment industry, and she became an actress and reality TV star. Her first acting experience was in the film “Haggard” in 2003, which was directed by her future husband, Bam Margera, and starred Melissa next to Margera himself, Ryan Dunn and Brandon DiCamillo. However, since the then, Missy had only one more acting credit, as Hot Nurse in the film “Minghags” in 2009, directed by Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo, but also in the ‘best of’ series on TV – “Howard Stern on Demand” in 2006 and ‘07.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/screen-shot-2017-05-12-at-105917.jpg><h2><span id=National_Stardom>National Stardom</span></h2><p>When it was revealed that Bam and Missy were dating, her name became more popular in the media, and everybody wanted to know more about Melissa Rothstein. However, she managed to continue hiding almost all the important details about her life. She started appearing with Bam on TV, such as in the reality show “Bam’s Unholy Union”, which showcased the lifestyle of Bam and Missy before their official marriage. The show became quite popular, and Melissa was slowly becoming a star. Her next appearance was in Margera’s comedy film “ Bam Margera Presents: Where the #$&% Is Santa?” in 2008, starring Bam, Brandon Novak, Mark The Bagger and others, with the film’s theme celebrating Christmas and finding Santa Claus in the comedic style of Bam Margera. After that, Melissa became focused on other enterprises and endeavors, of which there is no information in the media.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_with_Bam_Margera_Wedding_Divorce>Relationship with Bam Margera, Wedding, Divorce</span></h2>Bam and Melissa know each other from attending West Chester East High School. The two remained in contact afterwards, and it was in the early 2000s that their relationship started. Gradually, their bond grew and their relationship became stronger, leading to marriage. Actually we might never have heard about Melissa if it wasn’t for Bam, as once they got re-acquainted, Bam cast her in his film “Haggard”, during which their love was born. Their wedding ceremony was held on the 3rd February 2007, at the Loews Hotel in downtown Philadelphia, attended by many celebrities, including Bam’s celebrity friends such as Ryan Dunn, who passed away in 2011. All thought that this was a ‘happily ever after’ relationship, but this wasn’t the case, as from 2010 the couple started experiencing problems, and for the last two years of their marriage, Missy and Bam lived in different cities and saw each other once a week. It all crumbled in the end as the two divorced in 2012. No official reason has been made available for their divorce, however, according to some reports, Bam had been involved in several extra-marital affairs, including girlfriends in West Chester, and San Francisco. She and Bam didn’t have children together.<h2><span id=Life_After_Divorce>Life After Divorce</span></h2><p>Following their divorce, Melissa has been away from the public eye, keeping a low profile in regards to both career and personal endeavors. Hopefully, she re-emerges into the spotlight in the near future, as her fans are many and want to know about her life and career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AP591596091662.jpg><h2><span id=Melissa_Rothstein_Net_Worth>Melissa Rothstein Net Worth</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much information about Melissa’s career, just her work with Bam, which pretty much made her a star. So, have you ever wondered how rich Melissa Rothstein is, as of late 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Melissa Rothstein’s net worth is as high as $1 million. Pretty decent, don’t you think?</p><h2><span id=Bam_Margera>Bam Margera</span></h2><p>Let’s share some information about Missy’s ex-husband, now that we have told you everything there is to know about her. Born <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brandon Cole Margera</a> on the 28th September 1979, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, to April and Phil Margera, he has an older brother, Jess Margera, who is the drummer of the band CKY. His nickname Bam comes from when he was only three years old when his grandfather started calling him Bam Bam. His grandfather noticed that Brandon often ran into walls on purpose, and therefore the nickname Bam Bam, which then became Bam. He is a skateboarder, stuntmen, actor, musician and so much more, but best known to the world for his work with stunt crew and actors, known as Jackass. They have released five “Jackass” films, between 2002 to 2011.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Squad goals right here. <a rel=nofollow href=#>#vivalabam</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#bammargera</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#hellraisers</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/N8ouxPZly1</a></p><p>— Bam Margera Merch (@bam_merch) <a rel=nofollow href=#>September 22, 2018</a></p><p>Following his divorce from Missy, Bam continued his life and is married Nicole Boyd.<br>His wealth is estimated at $50 million.

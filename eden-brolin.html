However, she replied that:</p><p>No, I didn’t know. I was always kind of curious about it. But you can say that about so many generations and so many different industries. And yet, I grew up sort of distanced from it, so I had more of curiosity around it that sort of curated this interest in what it was to be a part of making movies and TV.</p><p>Additionally, Brolin clarified that she always wanted to follow in her father's footsteps from an early age.</p><p><i><strong>For more interesting biographies, do visit </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb.</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6bnqZdl7%2BwuMin</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feden-brolin.html&text=All%20About%20Eden%20Brolin%2c%20Josh%20Brolin%20-%20Bio%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feden-brolin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feden-brolin.html&title=All%20About%20Eden%20Brolin%2c%20Josh%20Brolin%20-%20Bio%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feden-brolin.html&title=All%20About%20Eden%20Brolin%2c%20Josh%20Brolin%20-%20Bio%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feden-brolin.html&title=All%20About%20Eden%20Brolin%2c%20Josh%20Brolin%20-%20Bio%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feden-brolin.html&description=All%20About%20Eden%20Brolin%2c%20Josh%20Brolin%20-%20Bio%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elpidia-carrillo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elpidia Carrillo Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gus-alfieri-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shocking News Gus Alfieri Obituary : In loving memory of Long Island basketball icon, Gus Alfieri">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

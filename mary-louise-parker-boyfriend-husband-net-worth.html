And portraying his adoptive mother “Teresa Kaepernick” was the seasoned actress Mary Louise-Parker, who critics believe did a pretty good job at it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But while Mary’s on-screen feat is no mystery to many, what about her personal life? Did she have a boyfriend, or perhaps a husband? Learn all about it as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Does Mary Louise-Parker Have A Husband Or Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2021, Mary Louise-Parker kept her relationship under the wraps. It was unclear if she had a boyfriend or husband at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her last known relationship was with Charlie Mars, a musician she met in 2009. The two made quite a ruckus at the time, given their 10 years age difference. Some media outlets even labeled her as a “cougar.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They broke up a few years later.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary has also appeared in one of Charlie’s music videos titled “Listen to the Darkside” while they were together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Charlie, Mary was dated her </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Weeds</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan for a year before calling it quits in 2007. However, the two decided to try things out again, patched up, and even got engaged in 2008. But what isn’t meant to be will never be. They broke up again before Jeffrey’s dream of becoming Mary’s husband came true.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary’s most well-known relationship in her entire dating history was with the American actor, Billy Crudup. The couple was together for eight years from 1996 to 2003. What’s unfortunate was that Mary was seven months pregnant with their child, while Billy left her for Claire Danes.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Mary finds her then-born son, William Atticus Parker, as a blessing. Also, she later went on to adopt a daughter from Africa in 2007 named Caroline Aberash Parker.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She shared that her daughter has an incredible laugh, “bubbly like soda pop.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For the future man who’ll love her daughter, Mary wrote a letter in her book — “If she has given you children, remind yourself every day of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth words in this sentence”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she added that if her daughter is ever hurt “irreparably”, she will send out people to hurt him back. Mary even asked him to be a friend to her brother, and help each other out.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary has also been romantically involved with Adam Duritz from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Counting Crows</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, celebrity trainer Pat Mannochia, and actor Timothy Hutton.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since Mary loved penning her thoughts, in a letter titled “Dear Cerberus”, she merged three of her terrible exes into the mythical three-headed dog. Where one of those men drags her into a public bathroom and punishes her for dressing like a “slut” by sexually assaulting her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Trivia:</strong> Mary and her kids made up a game called “Name That Beverage” when William (at 6) was sick and needed to hydrate</span></p><h3><b>What Is Mary Louise-Parker Famous For?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary Louise-Parker is best recognized for winning Tony awards for the broadway production </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Proof</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2001.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she has earned a Tony nomination for the Broadway show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Reckless</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and a Golden Globe, and several Emmy nominations for her uncanny performance as Nancy Botwin in the TV series</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Weeds</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2005).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary was also listed as one of twelve “Promising New Actors of 1990” in John Willis’ Screen World, Vol. 42.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some of her popular movies and TV shows are </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The West Wing</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2001), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Angels in America </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2003), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RED</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2010), and</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Mr. Mercedes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2017).

Her book </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dear Mr. You</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> comprises a series of letters that she’s written to men. But the idea about writing “a more traditional kind of book”&nbsp; came from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Esquire</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. “They asked me to write something about men in general, and it came out in letter form,” she said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary even confessed to operating “like a man in some ways”.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Mary Louise-Parker Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary Louise-Parker garnered a net worth of a whopping $16 million by 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Don’t be surprised!

Though his father’s name is not known, it comes out clearly in one of his songs that he is serving a 55-year jail term. After his father’s imprisonment, YoungBoy’s mother left them with their grandmother. While staying with her, he broke his neck in a wrestling accident when he was four, the injury meaning that he had to wear a head brace until he healed, which resulted in scars on his forehead.</p><p>He attended Scotlandville Magnet High School ,before dropping out from the ninth grade. He decided to pursue his music passion, and teamed up with friends to form the band NBA. He faced challenges raising money for a studio session, so at one time Monique, the mother of his friend, NBA 3Three paid for his studio time. In one instance, YoungBoy NBA and his crew stole a car battery; later he was arrested for shooting and driving in Kentucky Street, the police stating that he was in the company of three people including the driver, and he was sentenced to juvenile detention in Tallulah, Louisiana. It was during his six-month confinement that he wrote lyrics for what would later be his debut mixtape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Youngboy-Never-Broke-Again-Pub-Photo-1-Chris-Scheurich.jpg><p>After his time in detention, YoungBoy NBA was unfortunate to lose his grandmother, and the rapper was left to fend for himself, and he moved in with his fellow rapper, NBA 3Three. YoungBoy NBA has two siblings, his big sister Telee Gaulden, who was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a younger brother Ken Gaulden, the two spending a lot of time together, and it will be no surprise if Ken ends up in his brother’s music footsteps.

In the year 2008, he invested a sum of 300,000 Rubles in the stocks of 5 oil and gas companies which were Gazprom, Aurgutneftegar, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Gazprom Neft. This made him an activist shareholder of the companies and then he aimed at making the financial assets of these companies transparent.</p><p>In November 2010, confidential documents about ‘’Trasneft’s Auditing’’ were published. According to his blog, about 4 Billion Rubles were stolen by their leaders during the construction of the ‘Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline’. In December 2010, he announced the launch of a project titled ‘RosPil’ which seeks to bring to light the corrupt practices in the government procurement process.</p><p>In May 2011, he launched another project called ‘RosYama’ which means ‘Russian Hole’. This one allowed the citizen to track government responses to complaints and to report potholes.&nbsp;</p><p>In August 2011, he released papers related to a real estate deal between the Hungarian and Russian government which was a scandal. According to the publicized material, there were selling and purchasing of a former embassy building in Moscow and irregularities in the paper trail. 3 Hungarian officers were detained but no investigation was conducted by the Russian government.</p><p>In May 2012 he accused Igor Shuvalov, the Deputy Prime Minister of corruption saying that the companies owned by Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich had transferred huge amounts of money to Shuvalov’s Company to share in the profit of the purchase of Corus, the British Steel Company purchased by Usmanov. He also posted scans of documents and showed money transfers to which Igor said that the documents are legitimate but the transaction has not violated any Russian law.</p><p>In July 2012, he posted some documents on his blog and showed that the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin owned an undeclared business in the Czech Republic. In August 2018, he alleged Victor Zoltov to have stolen about $29 Million for the National Guard of Russia from procurement contacts. Shortly after this, Navalny was jailed for staging protests and Viktor also posted a video message defaming Navalny.</p><p>In March 2017, Navalny and the FBKreleased the documentary titled ‘He is Not Dimon to You’ which accused Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister and the former president of Russia of corruption.</p><p>On 26 March he organized some of the anti-corruption rallies across Russia. Some of which were sanctioned while others were not. Many were caught which lead to a protest in which according to Moscow police 500 people were detained while according to the human rights group OVD-info 1030 people including Navalny himself were detained in Moscow alone. Navalny was also fined 20,000 Rubles for organizing illegal protests and jailed for 15 days due to resisting arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>On 19 January 2021, an investigation was published by Navalny and FBK accusing Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia of using fraudulently obtained funds to build a huge estate for himself in Krasnodar Krai, near the town of Gelendzhik. He called it ‘the world’s biggest bribe’. According to the reports, the estate is 39 times that of Monaco and would cost over 100 Billion Rubles that is $1.35 Billion to construct. Navalny published very thorough details this time including blueprints and drone footages from the house. This gained about 20 Million views on YouTube in less than a day.</p><p>In the year 2000, he joined Yabloko, the Russian United Democratic Party. In 2001 he was listed as a member of Yabloko. In the year 2002, he was elected to the regional council of Moscow. In the year 2003, he headed the election campaign of the party for the parliamentary election in December of the Moscow subdivision. From April 2004 to February 2007, he remained at the Chief of Staff of the Moscow branch at Yabloko, and from 2006 to 2007 he was a member of the Federal Council of Yabloko.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/alexei-navalny-9.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In August 2005, he took part as a candidate by incorporating himself into the Social Council of Central Administrative Okrug of Moscow, created before the Moscow city Duma election held later that year. In November 2005, he became one of the initiators of the Youth Public Chamber, which intended to help the younger politicians to take part in the legislative initiatives.</p><p>In 2005, he started a Youth Social Movement called ‘’DA! – Democratic Alternative’’. He later also organized TV debates through the state-run Moscow channel called TV Center. These 1st 2 episodes showed high ratings but then it was suddenly canceled.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversy></span><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On 20 June 2012, it was officially announced that Navalny’s people will develop a new political party. This one will be based on e-democracy. At that moment he declared it will not be part of the party. On 15 December 2012, he said ‘’The People’s Alliance is my Party’’. He said this but didn’t join in due to the criminal cases against him. After some obstacles, on 15 September he declared he would join and may head the party. On 17 November, he was elected as the leader of the party. Again there were obstacles in the registration. The party initiated a coalition of democratic parties on 17 April.</p><p>On 27 April 2017, he was attacked outside his office in the anti-corruption foundation. This was done by unknown assailants who sprayed brilliant green dye components on his face. In this, he lost 80% of his sight in the right eye.</p><p>He has been arrested several times by the Russian authorities and received 2 suspended sentences for embezzlement in 2 cases. Both were considered politically motivated to Barr him from running him in future elections.</p><p>On 20 August 2020, during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow, he was poisoned by a nerve agent and was rushed to the hospital in serious condition. No criminal investigation took place.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of the year 2022, Alexei Navalny’s net worth is $10 Million.

Any information about Victoria’s ex-husband is unavailable though.</p><p>RGIP star Victoria was single coming to the show. Now, however, she is all ready to start a new chapter in her life and explore all the romantic opportunities in front of the cameras.</p><h3><strong>Victoria Zito Job</strong></h3><p>In the US, Victoria Zito worked as the Production Manager and Stylist for Kona Body. Soon, she started working for Firefly Trend as a social media and digital marketing consultant, merchandising intern, and assistant buyer.</p><p>Passionate about fashion, Victoria joined El Centro College and started studying passion.

By being open about plastic surgery, Victoria believes young women will feel empowered and it will also help them choose what they want for themselves.</p><p>In another story, the Real Girlfriends In Paris star Victoria revealed her own surgeries, which include lip fillers, cheekbone fillers, and chin fillers.</p><h3><strong>Victoria Zito Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Victoria Zito’s family, her mother’s name is Terrie Zito and she was 63 years old in 2022.

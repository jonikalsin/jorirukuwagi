At some point, the show moved into other game systems in later arcs.</p><p>During an interview, Griffin declared:</p><p><strong>”We started in 20… 14, I think? So like, four years? I don’t know that much about RPGs is the god’s honest truth, and D&D we played for three years and I think anybody who ever listened to The Adventure Zone will tell you that I still don’t really know how to play D&D.”</strong></p><p>His father, Clint, also stars in The Adventure Zone.</p><h2><strong>Til Death Do Us Blart</strong></h2><p>Since 2015, the brothers also co-host a yearly podcast with Guy Montgomery and Tim Batt, released every American Thanksgiving, called Til Death Do Us Blart, where they review the film Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.</p><p>In 2016, the brothers starred in a 2016 TV show based on the podcast that initially aired on Seeso.</p><p>In 2017, Griffin provided voice commentary for the video game 100ft Robot Golf.</p><p>In 2018, in order to focus on his podcasting career and family, Griffin left Polygon. In the same year, he appeared as a guest voice actor for the animated comedy series Big City Greens.</p><h2><strong>Wife & Wedding</strong></h2><p>In 2013, Griffin McElroy married Rachel McElroy.</p><p>Since September 6, 2017, Griffin and his wife co-host the podcast Wonderful! (a weekly podcast that features the hosts discussing a diverse assortment of things they love, with showcases of submitted topics that listeners are excited about).</p><p>The couple had previously hosted Rose Buddies, a weekly podcast that featured the hosts recapping and discussing the most recent episodes of the television series The Bachelor.

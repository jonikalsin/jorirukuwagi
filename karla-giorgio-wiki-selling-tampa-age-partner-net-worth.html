From Kayla’s Selling Tampa Stint to her dating life and net worth–we’ve got you covered.</p><h3><strong>Karla Giorgio On Selling Tampa</strong></h3><p>Selling Tampa will follow the day-to-day operations at Florida’s Allure Realty, a team headed by CEO Sharelle Rosado who hired an all-Black, all-women staff two years ago to make a point.</p><p>The logline of the show goes as “Sharelle has big plans for her brokerage and won’t let anyone or anything get in the way of making her dreams a reality.”</p><p>As the boss of the group, Sharelle will definitely be a big part of the Netflix show. Other than her, 7 realtors will appear. They are Karla Giorgio, <a href=#>Rena Frazier</a>, Tennille Moore, <a href=#>Juawana Williams</a>, <a href=#>Colony Reeves</a>, Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere, and Alexis Williams.</p><p>Karla Giorgia did not bother to hide her excitement about the show, Selling Tampa, as she shared the promotional video of the Netflix show. On November 25, 2021, Karla also shared the promotional picture of Selling Tampa on her Instagram handle and wrote: “Look at me and my gorgeous colleagues dominating the real estate market!! Fresh market, fresh attitude. Selling Tampa pre”</p><p>As to what kind of show we can expect, Netflix promises that all of the women are “equally as fun as they are fiercely ambitious” with “all of them vying to be on top” of the real estate game.</p><p>Although it has not been long since Allure Realty was formed, the real estate group has earned various awards and recognitions. Moreover, Allure Realty was even nominated for the award “Best Real Estate Company” in Best of the Bay 2021. The realtors themselves have also won several awards.</p><p>Selling Tampa will premiere on Netflix on December 15, 2021, whereas the fourth season of Selling Sunset drops on Netflix on November 24. All though there has not been a separate official trailer for Selling Tampa, Netflix teased both series in a single promo video. Toward the end of the video, we could see Oppenheim, who was surrounded by all his agents throwing the keys to Sharelle Rosado, dressed from head to toe in pink, just like her agents.</p><p>Selling Tampa will have eight episodes in a season instead of Selling Sunset’s typical 10. Also, Selling Tampa’s episodes will run for 15 minutes more compared to Selling Sunset Season 4’s 30-minute episodes.</p><h3><strong>Karla Giorgio Age</strong></h3><p>Karla Giorgio was reportedly born in the year 1988.

She graduated from there in 2008.</p><p>While we don’t how the amount Karla Giorgio makes as a realtor, her net worth has been reported to be around $800 thousand as of November 2021.</p><h3><strong>Karla Giorgio Partner: Is She Married Or Dating?</strong></h3><p>Unlike her professional career, her personal life is still a puzzle to be solved. Karla Giorgio rarely posts anything about her personal life on social media, which makes it really hard to know if she is married or still dating.</p><p>However, what we know for sure is that she has at least two kids. On February 1, 2021, Karla took to Instagram to share a picture of herself taking care of her kids. Alongside the picture, she wrote the caption: “Mommy First. On my birthday I lay here with a broken foot, Injured and Loved, this is all I need”</p><p>The other, she also posted about having baby fever, but it was in a funny way.</p><h3><strong>Karla Giorgio Height</strong></h3><p>Karla Giorgio stands at an average height of 5 feet 8 inches and weighs no further than 70 kilograms.

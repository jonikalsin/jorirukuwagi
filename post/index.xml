長く応援してきたファンを騒がせていますが、その後、すぐにアドミンさん本人の謝罪動画が投稿されています。
これまでにもゲーム実況での炎上事件は多数ありましたす、実況中にリスナを非難、自分がコメント欄で非難されたりが大抵の原因です。
しかし、今回のアドミンさんの炎上の理由は過去ある炎上とは少し違った内容です。
子共じみてるといういうか、果たして本当にプロのゲーム配信者がやったことか？と驚きます。
アドミンが炎上の理由→仲悪いトナカイトをコーチ説明中に無言で殺しまくる 2021年6月24日の時点での炎上の話です。
アドミンさんがゲーム配信中にとんでもない行動に出て大炎上しているとのことですが、その内容について簡潔に振り返ってみたいと思います。
現在の時点でアドミンさんの炎上の理由となった場面が乗っている動画は非公開になっています。
しかし、炎上するまでの経歴自体はツイッターに残っています。
つべのコメ欄に有能がいた
あどみん炎上騒動について pic.twitter.com/EQ7uXTaB1M
— Luxarei😈@サムライマック (@metametamooooon) June 20, 2021 要は、アドミンさんがコーツの説明中に、無言で味方の「トナカイト」さんを殺し続けたということです。
アドミンさんはコーチ説明が終わるまで、ずっとトナカイトさんを殺し続けたのです。
しかし、自分の配信ではコーチの話をまったく聞かず、ご飯をクチャクチャ食べながら、自分のリスナーと関係ない話（自分のキャラの話）をしていたそうです。
アドミンとトナカイトは昔から不仲で絶縁状態の過去があった？ なぜ、関係ないところでトナカイトさんは殺されまくったのか・・・。
実はシンプルにアドミンさんがトナカイトのことが大っ嫌いということが理由だと憶測されてます。
そりゃ、好きな人に対してあんなことしないですよね。
アドミンは謝罪動画の中で引退を検討？ ちなみに6月23日にアドミンが謝罪動画を投稿していました。
動画の内容は、お酒の席でリスナーの愚痴を言ったことに対する謝罪で、トナカイトさんに対する謝罪ではありませんでした。
嫌いが故に素直になれない意地でしょうか？
動画では配信されているのに、人としての配慮もなく自分に非があったこと、配信外であれば問題なかったものの、たくさんのリスナーが聞いていたところであんな態度を取りリスナーに不快な思いをさせたことをメインに謝罪。
自分のリスナーに対しては、しっかりと悔やんでいます。
ちなみに、過去にトナカイトとトラブルがあり共演NGだったことは否定していました。NG疑惑についてはデマだそうです。
アドミンさんは今後のゲーム実況の活動については引退も検討してるそうです。
アドミンさんが一番落ち込んでいたのは、Apex Legendsを中心としたゲーム実況チームのKNR(このり)のブランドを傷つけてしまったとです。
完全にソロで活動をするかもしれないと。一応は、この後メンバーとの話し合って決めるそうです。

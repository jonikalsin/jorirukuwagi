The accident occurred on Monday when Liv’s vehicle crashed into a tree, erupting into flames on Burnt Hickory Road near Devonwood Trail in Marietta, Georgia.</p><p>Liv Teverino, known as an athlete and a scholar, was a student deeply involved in her school’s community. She was a prominent member of the MHS International Baccalaureate Programme and the state-champion cross-country team, embodying passion and dedication in all her endeavors. Beyond the school walls, she was recognized as a community leader and was part of this year’s Cobb Youth Leadership cohort.</p><p>Becky Drew Avery shared Obituary of Liv Teverino and wrote,</p><p>“Although I do not dispute that babies come into the world with their own spiritual journey and their own purpose, these things don’t come to fruition without the balanced guidance of loving parents. We pour into our children with the hope and expectation that THEY will find their own path and make their own impact. We strive for them, we pray for them, we sacrifice for them. And, when it all works well, we end up with children like Liv.<br>Parents take heed: it matters how you raise your kids. It matters that they are surrounded with community. It matters that they learn to embrace those who are not like them. It matters that we teach kindness and humility. It matters that they understand they are NOT the center of all things. It matters that they know a God who is bigger than their social media account.<br>All of our hearts are broken for the loss that these parents and siblings are facing. And while I know that Jesus welcomed Liv with joy and that familiar expression, “well done good and faithful servant,” I know that he also whispers those words, as he weeps with them, to Scot, Beth, Luke and Brenden.<br>What a gift they gave to this community in Liv Teverino.”</p><p>Superintendent Grant Rivera from Marietta Police Department expressed their condolences, praising Liv’s accomplishments and the mark of excellence she left behind. On Tuesday morning, the school district united to pay tribute to Liv, providing support for students and staff grappling with the tragedy.</p><p>Liv’s friends and classmates remembered her as a caring and loving individual. Isaac Phillips, a long-time friend, spoke of Liv’s exemplary life, emphasizing how she impacted everyone she met. Friends and the school community paid their respects by gathering at a memorial in the school’s parking lot, leaving flowers and heartfelt messages for Liv.</p><p>Liv’s favorite color, yellow, was symbolically chosen for the flowers placed at the crash site. Family friend Carla Manuel described Liv as a shining star, an athlete, and an all-around sweet girl who was deeply loved by all. The Marietta High School community, along with families of the students, received a letter urging support and communication during this difficult time.</p><p>Liv Teverino’s tragic passing has left an irreplaceable void in the hearts of those who knew her, leaving behind a legacy of kindness, dedication, and community spirit.</p><h2>Liv Teverino Obituary</h2><p>On Monday, September 18, 2023, Liv Helen Teverino, daughter, sister, granddaughter, and beloved friend, passed away suddenly at the age of 16. She was born on June 5, 2007 in Atlanta, GA. Liv was a joyful young lady, and a bright light to all who knew her.</p><p>As a junior at Marietta High School, Liv was an outstanding student, actively involved in various academic and community pursuits. She excelled as a full International Baccalaureate student and was a proud member of esteemed organizations like the National Honor Society, Beta Club, and the Cobb Youth Leadership program. Liv’s dedication to her faith shone through her involvement in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes leadership team, where she shared her love for the Lord.</p><p>Liv’s passion for the arts was evident in her early years as a dancer at the Georgia Dance Conservatory, showcasing grace and poise in ballet, modern dance, and jazz performances. In high school, she transitioned to track and cross country, achieving remarkable success as a member of the state championship cross country team. Additionally, Liv embraced her brother’s legacy, dedicating eight years to the Lee’s Crossing Cyclones summer swim league.</p><p>A devout believer, Liv actively participated in Saint Joseph Catholic Church, serving as an altar server and engaging with multiple youth groups. Christ was the center of her life, and her faith radiated through her actions and interactions with others.</p><p>Liv leaves behind her grieving parents, Scot and Beth Teverino, along with her cherished brothers, Luke and Brendan. She is also survived by her loving paternal grandparents, Tony and Eleanor Teverino of Mentone, Alabama, and maternal grandparents, Elizabeth (Betty) Molloy of Decatur, GA, and Joseph Molloy.</p><p>In honor of Liv Helen Teverino, a funeral service will be held on <strong>Monday, September 25, 2023, at 10 a.m.</strong> at Saint Joseph Catholic Church, Marietta. Friends and family are invited to pay their respects during visitation on Sunday, September 24, 2023, from 2-4 p.m. at Mayes Ward Dobbins funeral home on the Marietta Square. A vigil service will follow the visitation in the funeral home’s chapel. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Marietta Schools Foundation in Liv’s memory to establish a scholarship that celebrates her extraordinary life and legacy at 144 Polk Street, Marietta, GA 30064. Liv’s light will continue to shine through the lives she touched, leaving an everlasting impact on all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kuarCjK2cr52inruwec6boK2tkafGbrnAq6CerKSWeqm1xqFkrJuYpLytedKtrJ2dnql6rLXLpZydZZmjeqSt0WaYnJuZmbKvwIyipWaflaS%2FqLXAaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html&text=Liv%20Teverino%20Obituary%3a%20Marietta%20High%20School%20student%20killed%20in%20car%20accident%20in%20Georgia&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html&title=Liv%20Teverino%20Obituary%3a%20Marietta%20High%20School%20student%20killed%20in%20car%20accident%20in%20Georgia" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html&title=Liv%20Teverino%20Obituary%3a%20Marietta%20High%20School%20student%20killed%20in%20car%20accident%20in%20Georgia" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html&title=Liv%20Teverino%20Obituary%3a%20Marietta%20High%20School%20student%20killed%20in%20car%20accident%20in%20Georgia" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliv-teverino-obituary-marietta-high-school-student-killed-in-car-accident-in-georgia.html&description=Liv%20Teverino%20Obituary%3a%20Marietta%20High%20School%20student%20killed%20in%20car%20accident%20in%20Georgia" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-and-calvin-lamont-parents-patrick-and-dawn-lamont.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet HGTV Chris And Calvin LaMont Parents: Patrick And Dawn Lamont!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-gol-d-roger-have-devil-fruit-powers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Gol D.

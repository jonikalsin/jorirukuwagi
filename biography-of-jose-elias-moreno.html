His father is the also famous actor José Elías Moreno Padilla and Beatriz González deCossío. She has two sisters, who respond to the names of Beatriz and Angelina Moreno.</p><p>By inheritance of his father, since childhood&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno&nbsp;</strong>showed interest in the world of the spectacle of acting, being that it is considered that the beginnings of his artistic career occurred back in 1976, when he made his debut with the film known with the name of Survivors of the Andes, in which he was in charge of the interpretation of the character of Rodrigo Fernández.</p><p>The following year, in 1977 and until 1978,&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno&nbsp;</strong>gave life to the character of Lacho in the telenovela called Marcha nupcial. While in the middle of 1978 he gave life to Polo in the telenovela of Mamá Campanita. Later, in 1979 and until 1980 we saw him in J.J Juez as Rodrigo Garmendia.</p><h2>Trajectory and history of José Elías Moreno</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the artistic and professional career of José Elías Moreno was full of great successes in melodramas that he could star in being generally the protagonist of famous melodramas, achieving that over the years he was consecrating himself<strong>&nbsp;and calling José Elías Moreno</strong>&nbsp;<strong>one of the best actors on Mexican television.</strong></p><p>After a successful career in the 80s and 90s, in the 00s&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno&nbsp;</strong>was stage director of Ni contigo ni sin ti, where he was also part of the cast in the skin of the character of Dr. Esteban Lieja. It was in that same year when he was nominated at the TVyNovelas Awards with the category of “best first actor” thanks to his performance in Niña de mi corazón. The following year, in 2012, we saw him in the telenovela called Amor bravío as Leoncio Martínez. In that same year he was stage director in the telenovela known under the title of La mujer del Vendaval.</p><p><strong>José Elías Moreno</strong>&nbsp;after dedicating himself to acting decided to also undertake as a producer and creator of telenovelas and said in an interview that his facet as a director&nbsp;<strong>of telenovelas</strong>&nbsp;was something he wanted to do since he studied acting;&nbsp;“Since theater school I wanted to direct and now I have been doing it for 10 years, it was something that came in my personal goals and I like it a lot.”</p><p>In the artistic career of&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno</strong>, being of our knowledge that during the past year 2020 he made his appearance in the telenovela Vencer el desamor. While in the current year 2021 he is part of the cast of Fuego ardiente (as Father Mateo Ocampo) and Designing your love (with the character of Horacio) where he shared credits with great stars such as&nbsp;Juan Diego Covarrubias,&nbsp;Sergio Goyri,&nbsp;Martha Julia, among others.</p><p>Another of the great professional successes for the lactor was when&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno became leader of the ANDA (National Association of Actors)&nbsp;</strong>but as expected there were several detractors of his mandate, one of them was Andrés García who assured that they were not paying him his royalties.&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno</strong>&nbsp;did not remain silent and responded to the accusations of the actor and denied that as he assured he was owed a lot of money: “Yes it has been paid, and we have here (the vouchers).”&nbsp;<strong>José Elías Moreno as director of the ANDA</strong>&nbsp;shared with&nbsp;Leticia Calderón&nbsp;who was vice president and&nbsp;Arlette Pacheco&nbsp;as a member.</p><p>But not all of it was good news for the Mexican actor because when the coronavirus pandemic hit the whole world and especially Mexico,<strong>&nbsp;José Elías Moreno confessed that he suffered from COVID-19</strong>, a condition that kept him bedridden for about a month and a half, and for which he suffered a serious symptomatology that led him to endanger his life, He even thought he would die because he wasn’t having good oxygen levels.&nbsp;“Yes, I was very bad, I got pneumonia with very low oxygenation, there were no hospitals, there were no beds, no kidding, so my wife and son (took care of me). I really lost my mind, at that time Christmas and New Year passed… and they passed… (About a will) I didn’t think I’m honest with you. Yes, it was a big scare.”&nbsp;Luckily the actor was able to overcome COVID.</p><p>Another of the telenovelas in which<strong>&nbsp;José Elías Moreno appeared as part of the stellar cast was in the melodrama entitled “Amor Dividido”,</strong>&nbsp;premiered at the beginning of 2022 and produced by Angelli Nesma Medina for Televisa. For this&nbsp;<strong>telenovela “Amor Dividido” José Elías Moreno played Domingo Moreno</strong>&nbsp;and at the time commented how happy he was doing this role because it was a type of character that he had never done before,&nbsp;“Without a doubt I love my character in Divided Love because it has made me experience a new facet in me being undoubtedly a great acting challenge that I really wanted to be able to live and to be able to do this character is something quite enriching for my career.”</p><p>One of the most important projects for Televisa in 2022 was the premiere of the remake of “La Madrastra” which had already been done on several occasions and television stations but again was adapted to new technologies and audiovisual proposals.&nbsp;<strong>In the television series “La Madrastra” the actor&nbsp;José Elías Moreno&nbsp;played Santino González.</strong></p><h2>Children and wife of José Elías Moreno</h2><p>As far as the love life of José Elías Moreno is concerned, he<strong>&nbsp;is married to his wife named Maru de Moreno</strong>, with whom he has been the father of three children, who respond to the names of: Elías, María and Andrea.</p><h2>Pack de José Elías Moreno</h2><p>Although in social networks and on the internet people look a lot for the pack of José Elías Moreno or photos in which you can see with little clothes or in sensual poses, the truth is that at present there is no pack of José Elías Moreno more than those photos that the artist has published in his own networks and that could be considered sexy.</p><h2>How much is the fortune of José Elías Moreno?</h2><p>This is one of the questions that people ask the most about José Elías Moreno and although they always end up answering it on other pages with a “I do not know” or “it depends” if there are some estimates that several web portals mention. However, it is not possible to make an exact calculation about the fortune of this great star that is José Elías Moreno within the middle of the show, even so more than being interested in the fortune of a person the important thing is the talent he has and that I have made that this within the great figures of the international entertainment medium.</p><p>No doubt the career of this great star José Elías Moreno will continue to rise and we will be attentive to everything that happens around him, so we invite you not to take off from our page for the next updates we will have in the&nbsp;<strong>life, trajectory, history and biography of José Elías Moreno.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOm6Con6KWvanFjKidZqKfqLJuscuimKxlnaS%2FprrOaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html&text=Biography%20of%20Jos%20Elas%20Moreno&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html&title=Biography%20of%20Jos%20Elas%20Moreno" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html&title=Biography%20of%20Jos%20Elas%20Moreno" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html&title=Biography%20of%20Jos%20Elas%20Moreno" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbiography-of-jose-elias-moreno.html&description=Biography%20of%20Jos%20Elas%20Moreno" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joie-chavis-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joie Chavis  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1-dead-in-east-orange-fire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="1 Dead In East Orange Fire">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Some other prominent names in the list include Rolex, Melin, VistaJet, Titleist and more.</p><p>Even though he is second on the PGA Tour's money list for tournament winnings, he makes much more money from endorsements than from prizes.</p><p>As of 2023, Mickelson has earned over $96 million in prize money on the PGA Tour. In 2022, he made an estimated $42 million from endorsements, while he only earned $140,608 from prize money.</p><h2 id=mizzenmain>1.

Callaway, his equipment sponsor has likely been a key factor in his victories in golf.</p><p>Since 2004, Mickelson has been using Callaway equipment, and his success on the golf course has been a great way to promote the brand.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.sportslulu.com/uploads/posts/66bb9c40-90f7-4cd9-85d2-0536827a78f6/phil-mickelson-callaway.webp></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Phil Mickelson</a> signed a five-year deal with Callaway for about $4 million in 2004. As part of this agreement, the 2013 Open Championship winner started using various golf equipment from Callaway, including the HX golf ball, Fusion driver, Big Bertha Woods, as well as Callaway shoes and gloves.</p><p>Apart from using Callaway clubs, Mickelson has teamed up with the company to create new golf products. One famous example is the Callaway Mack Daddy PM Grind Wedge, which Mickelson helped design. Additionally, the putter that Phil uses on the course is also made by Callaway.</p><h2 id=kpmg>3.

Together, they have also raised funds for charitable purposes through KPMG's charitable foundation.</p><p>However, in February 2022, KPMG and Mickelson mutually parted ways.

Besides, he has been in many advertisements for Workday, and the company has also supported some of his events.</p><p>However, in 2022, Workday Inc decided not to continue working with Phil as their brand ambassador because of the comments he made about the <a href=# rel=noopener>PGA Tour</a> and LIV Golf.</p><h2 id=exxonmobil>5. ExxonMobil</h2><p>Phil Mickelson and ExxonMobil had a sponsor partnership that lasted for over 16 years. It started in 2004 and lasted until the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The sponsorship deal was very valuable, reportedly worth $50 million each year.

The reason was that Mickelson decided to sign with Callaway instead.</p><p>The new contract with Callaway was said to be around $4 million per year, plus extra bonuses. Despite trying to renegotiate with Titleist, they could not reach an agreement, and Mickelson was allowed to leave the deal early.</p><p>However, Mickelson maintained a close relationship with the company and later co-founded Fox Wellness with Dave Phillips, the co-founder of the Titleist.</p><h2 id=vistajet>9. VistaJet</h2><p>Phil Mickelson signed an endorsement deal with VistaJet in 2020. VistaJet is a multinational private aviation company established in 2004.</p><p>It is one of few brands that remained affiliated with Phil Mickelson Sponsor Masters in 2023. After a year away from golf events, he returned to play for the Masters Tournament.</p><p>Mickelson talked to Forbes and shared that he sold his private jet and started flying with VistaJet.

They believed that Mickelson's fame and influence could be the key to bringing about a positive change and revitalizing the brand.</p><p>The collaboration started with a fresh advertising campaign aimed at reaching male customers from the Gen X generation and older age groups.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2022, Mickelson's statements about LIV Golf caused a lot of disagreement. As a result, Amstel Light decided to end their association with him, following the lead of their parent company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqOuZpOkunC8x6KjZqWZmLimuNKopWaroKS7tLvRrA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html&text=Phil%20Mickelson%20Clothing%20Sponsor%20%5bBrand%20Deals%5d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html&title=Phil%20Mickelson%20Clothing%20Sponsor%20%5bBrand%20Deals%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html&title=Phil%20Mickelson%20Clothing%20Sponsor%20%5bBrand%20Deals%5d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html&title=Phil%20Mickelson%20Clothing%20Sponsor%20%5bBrand%20Deals%5d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphil-mickelson-sponsors.html&description=Phil%20Mickelson%20Clothing%20Sponsor%20%5bBrand%20Deals%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bam-margera-former-wife-missy-margeras-wiki-sister-net-worth-divorce-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bam Margera former wife, Missy Margera's Wiki: sister, net worth, divorce">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./eric-lewis-wife-blair-lewis-nba-referee-scandal-retirement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA Referee Scandal &amp;amp; Retirement">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
